## Prospective Students
Our group is broadly interested in software engineering, programming languages, natural language processing, and deep learning. We are excited about tackling important, pressing, difficult problems via principled, elegant, practical solutions. Our work is published routinely in the best venues, but more importantly, our work strives for elegance and impact, both conceptual and practical. I am always excited to recruit excellent applicants who (1) share our research style and vision, (2) have solid background in pertinent areas, and (3) are interested in working at the intersection of theory and practice.

Our group has open positions for **PhD students, postdocs, research assistants, and visitors**. If you are interested in our group, please drop me an email.

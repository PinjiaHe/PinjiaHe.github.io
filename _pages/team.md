## Prospective Students
Our work is published routinely in the best venues, but more importantly, our work strives for elegance and impact, both conceptual and practical. Our group has open positions for **PhDs, MPhils, postdocs, research assistants, and visitors**. If you are interested in our group, please drop me an email.

**CUHK-SZ Undergrads:** Our team is happy to work with excellent undergraduate students. Interested students are encouraged to contact me or my students for details. To help match you with suitable projects and mentors, please share your general interests, a copy of your recent resume/CV, copies of your transcripts, and which recent paper(s) in my group you like.
